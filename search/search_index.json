Import Required Modules: Import the necessary modules for your plugin, including the <code>Tool</code> class from <code>langchain/tools</code> and any other modules your plugin might need.</p> <p>2. Define Your Plugin Class: Define a class for your plugin that extends the <code>Tool</code> class. Set the <code>name</code> and <code>description</code> properties in the constructor. If your plugin requires credentials or other variables, set them from the fields parameter or from a method that retrieves them from your process environment. Note: if your plugin requires long, detailed instructions, you can add a <code>description_for_model</code> property and make <code>description</code> more general.</p> <p>3. Define Helper Methods: Define helper methods within your class to handle specific tasks if needed.</p> <p>4. Implement the <code>_call</code> Method: Implement the <code>_call</code> method where the main functionality of your plugin is defined. This method is called when the language model decides to use your plugin. It should take an <code>input</code> parameter and return a result. If an error occurs, the function should return a string representing an error, rather than throwing an error. If your plugin requires multiple inputs from the LLM, read the StructuredTools section.</p> <p>5. Export Your Plugin and Import into handleTools.js: Export your plugin and import it into <code>handleTools.js</code>. Add your plugin to the <code>toolConstructors</code> object in the <code>loadTools</code> function. If your plugin requires more advanced initialization, add it to the <code>customConstructors</code> object.</p> <p>6. Export YourPlugin into index.js: Export your plugin into <code>index.js</code> under <code>tools</code>. Add your plugin to the <code>module.exports</code> of the <code>index.js</code>, so you also need to declare it as <code>const</code> in this file.</p> <p>7. Add Your Plugin to manifest.json: Add your plugin to <code>manifest.json</code>. Follow the strict format for each of the fields of the \"plugin\" object. If your plugin requires authentication, add those details under <code>authConfig</code> as an array. The <code>pluginKey</code> should match the class <code>name</code> of the Tool class you made, and the <code>authField</code> prop must match the process.env variable name.</p> <p>Remember, the key to creating a custom plugin is to extend the <code>Tool</code> class and implement the <code>_call</code> method.

If something is free, you are the product. If errors arise, they are more likely to be due to the 3rd party, and not this project, as I test the official endpoints first and foremost.</p> <p>You will get your API key from the discord server. The instructions are pretty clear when you join so I won't repeat them.</p> <p>Once you have the API key, you should adjust your .env file like this:</p> <pre><code>##########################\n# OpenAI Endpoint: \n##########################\nOPENAI_API_KEY=your-chimera-api-key\n# Reverse proxy settings for OpenAI: \nOPENAI_REVERSE_PROXY=https://chimeragpt.adventblocks.cc/api/v1/chat/completions\n\n# OPENAI_MODELS=gpt-3.5-turbo,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k,gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,text-davinci-003,gpt-4,gpt-4-0314,gpt-4-0613\n</code></pre> <p>Note: The <code>OPENAI_MODELS</code> variable is commented out so that the server can fetch chimeragpt/api/v1/models for all available models. Uncomment and adjust if you wish to specify which exact models you want to use.</p> <p>It's worth noting that not all models listed by their API will work, with or without this project. The exact URL may also change, just make sure you include <code>/v1/chat/completions</code> in the reverse proxy URL if it ever changes.</p> <p>You can set <code>OPENAI_API_KEY=user_provided</code> if you would like the user to add their own Chimera API key, just be sure you specify the models with <code>OPENAI_MODELS</code> in this case since they won't be able to be fetched without an admin set API key.</p>"},{"location":"install/free_ai_apis.html#thats-it-youre-all-set","title":"That's it!

EMAIL_USERNAME is the username of the email service (usually, it will be the email address, but in some cases, it can be an actual username used to access the account). EMAIL_PASSWORD is the password used to access the email service. This is not the password to access the email account directly, but a password specifically generated for this service. EMAIL_FROM is the email address that will appear in the \"from\" field when a user receives an email.</p>"},{"location":"install/user_auth_system.html#setup-with-gmail","title":"Setup with Gmail","text":"<ol> <li>Create a Google Account and enable 2-step verification.</li> <li>In the Google Account settings, click on the \"Security\" tab and open \"2-step verification.\"</li> <li>Scroll down and open \"App passwords.\" Choose \"Mail\" for the app and select \"Other\" for the device, then give it a random name.</li> <li>Click on \"Generate\" to create a password, and copy the generated password.</li> <li>In the .env file, modify the variables as follows:</li> </ol> <pre><code>EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail\nEMAIL_USERNAME=your-email\nEMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password\nEMAIL_FROM=email address for the from field, e.g., noreply@librechat.ai\n</code></pre> <p>NOTE: The variable EMAIL_FROM currently does not work.
